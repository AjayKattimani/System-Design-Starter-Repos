# Raftly — Bonus Exercise Provided Repo

## What's in Here

- **`requirements-request.md`** (in `../`) — the raw PM Slack message. Read this first.
- **`index.js`** — an Express server that implements everything the PM asked for. Some routes belong. Some don't.
- **`tests/routes.test.js`** — scaffold test file. You complete this.
- **`package.json`** — dependencies (express, jest, supertest).

## Your Four Deliverables (branch: `decode-and-repair`)

1. **`sort-note.md`** — 4-bucket categorised list, **under 80 words**. Use this template:

```
Scope: [item], [item], ...
Creep: [item] — one-line reason; [item] — one-line reason
Assumptions: [item] — what needs clarifying
Questions: [item] — why it blocks design
```

One line per item. Cite exact phrases from the PM message.

2. **`index.js`** — delete the scope-creep routes. The 5 MVP routes must remain.
3. **`tests/routes.test.js`** — fill in the test assertions. `npm test` must pass.
4. **`README.md`** — 1-2 sentences on what signals told you something was scope vs. creep.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
node index.js          # start the server
npm test               # run the tests (they will fail until you fix index.js and complete the tests)
```

Read `requirements-request.md` before touching any code — that message is the source of truth for which routes belong and which don't.
